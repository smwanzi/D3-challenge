          <h2>Health Risks vs Demographics</h2>
             <p>
                Have you ever wanted to know the relationship between certain health related factors and demographics? Wonder no more!
                Using data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a few of those factors have been analysed and visualized below using  Data-Driven Document (D3) from Javascript. 
                The idea is to have fun exploring the relationship between these Behavioral Health Risk Fctors; Healthcare, Obesity, Smoking vs Demograhics Factors; Income, Poverty and Age.

          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Poverty</h2>
          <p>Are poverty and obesity associated? According to the dataset used in this analysis, the answer would be yes. The data shows a strong negative correlation between household income, poverty and obesity. 
            Take for example In states like Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and West Virginia, where the average household income was below 45,000 US dollars a year, over 33 per cent of people were obese, 
            where as in more affluent states such as Colorado, DC, Hawaii Massachusetts or California, where households earned on average 65,000 US dollars a year, less than 24 per cent of people were obese.</p>
          <p>However, the data also shows Obesity rates are high across all demographic groups, albeit unevenly, take for example Colorado which has the lowest obesity, the rate is at 21.3% that is still high by any standards. 
            While this is not an in-depth analysis of cause and effect, it is worth noting that the causal effect it portrays needs further investigation. Especially for policy makers, who must come up with policies to improve health.</p>
